CMake Warning (dev) in /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindOpenMP.cmake:
  Policy CMP0011 is not set: Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH
  and POP.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0011" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The included script

    /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindOpenMP.cmake

  affects policy settings.  CMake is implying the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option for
  compatibility, so the effects are applied to the including context.
